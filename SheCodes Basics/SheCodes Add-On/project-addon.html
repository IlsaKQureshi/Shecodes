        The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term
        "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means
        'work'. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the first known use
        of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word
        comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment,
        labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which
        means to work strenuously, toil). In English, people still occasionally
        use the words travail, which means struggle. According to Simon
        Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words
        travel and travail both share an even more ancient root: a Roman
        instrument of torture called the tripalium (in Latin it means "three
        stakes", as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty
        of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be
        much easier, depending upon the destination. Travel to Mount Everest,
        the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure travel are more
        difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more difficult depending
        on the method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even by bullock
        cart. Reasons for traveling include recreation,holidays, rejuvenation,
        tourism or vacationing,research travel, the gathering of information,
        visiting people, volunteer travel for charity, migration to begin life
        somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and mission trips, business
        travel, trade, commuting, obtaining health care, waging or fleeing war,
        for the enjoyment of traveling, or other reasons. Travelers may use
        human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; or vehicles, such
        as public transport, automobiles, trains, ferries, boats, cruise ships
        and airplanes.
