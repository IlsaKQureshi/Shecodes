    <p>
      The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term
      "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means
      'work'. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, the first known use
      of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states that the word
      comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment,
      labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which
      means to work strenuously, toil). In English, people still occasionally
      use the words travail, which means struggle. According to Simon Winchester
      in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words travel and travail
      both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called
      the tripalium (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale). This
      link may reflect the extreme difficulty of travel in ancient times. Travel
      in modern times may or may not be much easier, depending upon the
      destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme
      tourism, and adventure travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel
      can also be more difficult depending on the method of travel, such as by
      bus, cruise ship, or even by bullock cart. Reasons for traveling include
      recreation,holidays, rejuvenation, tourism or vacationing,research travel,
      the gathering of information, visiting people, volunteer travel for
      charity, migration to begin life somewhere else, religious pilgrimages and
      mission trips, business travel, trade, commuting, obtaining health care,
      waging or fleeing war, for the enjoyment of traveling, or other reasons.
      Travelers may use human-powered transport such as walking or bicycling; or
      vehicles, such as public transport, automobiles, trains, ferries, boats,
      cruise ships and airplanes.
