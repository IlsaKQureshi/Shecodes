      <h6>WHY BRUSSELS?</h6>
      <h1>Brussels, the heart of Europe</h1>
      <p>
        Legend has it that Brussels grew from a small island settlement on the
        Senne River, a place the early inhabitants called Bruocsella—“the
        dwelling in the marsh.” Over centuries, this modest riverside village
        transformed into the heart of Europe, shaped by dukes, merchants, and
        later by diplomats who made it the political capital of the continent.
        Yet it wasn’t until much later, through the writings of local historians
        in the 19th century, that Brussels began to be affectionately described
        as a city defined by its hidden viewpoints, its gentle slopes and
        elevated quarters that quietly overlook the old town below. You can
        still trace the soul of ancient Brussels today. Beyond the grand
        government buildings and sleek European offices, past the bustling
        shopping galleries and artisanal chocolate shops, lie narrow cobbled
        streets where cafés serve crisp frites and warm waffles dusted with
        sugar.
